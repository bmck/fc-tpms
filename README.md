# fc-tpms
This repository provides a Rails-based web service for storing and analyzing data from TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system)
sensors, aimed towards the management of a fleet of commercial vehicles.

Along with the web service is a simple Android-based app, also for collecting, processing, and interpreting a sampled analog waveform 
(collected via a SDR receiver) based on the waveform being generated by a tire-pressure monitoring system.  Interpretation
can be performed via simple FDM analysis or Manchester encoding, though other interpretation schemes may be easily
implemented.  Lower level processing is performed via LiquidSDR.
