  # Change the logic here depending on how you use Devise.
  # For example, if you allow users to be created with just an email,
  # then this will always return true, so you'll need another thing to
  # check instead of `persisted?`
  #
  # The idea is that you want to differentiate between users who are signing
  # up for the first time (because `encrypted_password_changed?` will be true
  # for them), and those who are changing their password after having created
  # it for the first time.
